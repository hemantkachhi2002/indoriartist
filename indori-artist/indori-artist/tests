The `tests` directory is typically used for storing test files in a Laravel application. Below is a basic structure for the `tests` directory, including a sample test file to get you started.

Directory: indori-artist/tests

Contents of the `tests` directory:

- **Feature**: This subdirectory can contain feature tests.
- **Unit**: This subdirectory can contain unit tests.
- **TestCase.php**: This is the base test case class.

Here is the content for the `tests/TestCase.php` file:

<?php

namespace Tests;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\TestCase as BaseTestCase;

abstract class TestCase extends BaseTestCase
{
    use CreatesApplication;
}

And here is the structure for the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories:

- **tests/Feature**: This directory can be created to hold feature tests.
- **tests/Unit**: This directory can be created to hold unit tests.

You can create a sample test file in the `tests/Feature` directory:

Contents of the `tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php` file:

<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    /** @test */
    public function it_loads_the_home_page()
    {
        $response = $this->get('/');

        $response->assertStatus(200);
    }
}

This setup provides a basic structure for your tests and includes a sample test that checks if the home page loads successfully. You can expand upon this by adding more tests as needed.
