## Deployment

To deploy the application on Vercel, ensure that the `vercel.json` file is configured correctly to specify the output directory. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": { "distDir": "public" }
    }
  ],
  "outputDirectory": "public"
}
```

Make sure that the `public` directory contains the built files after running your build process. If your build process generates files in a different directory, update the `distDir` and `outputDirectory` accordingly.
